# Contributing to Strava2kilometrikisa

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests which trigger deployments.

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Ensure the test suite passes
1. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/jaamo/strava2kilometrikisa/compare)!

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/jaamo/strava2kilometrikisa/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening an issue](https://github.com/jaamo/strava2kilometrikisa/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports.
